{"title":"[Request] Looking for movies similair to Interstellar and The Martian","selftext":"","body":"As far as Interstellar is concerned, let us get the obvious answer out of the way first. Nolan has said that his inspiration and greatest influence for Interstellar was **2001: A Space Odyssey**. This sci-fi masterpiece shares Interstellar's theme of exploration and features a similarly \"confusing\" final sequence. It is a very slow-paced movie but has some heavy subtext and inspiring ideas and is considered a technical and aesthetic marvel. It has a much less lauded, yet still good sequel called **2010** that continues the theme of exploration and also shares Interstellar's idea of looking for a second home for humanity. Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky's similarly slow-paced and philosophical sci-fi movie **Solaris** is also considered a masterpiece and is sometimes likened to **2001**, however it is quite different from Interstellar.\n\nMatthew McConaughey previously starred in **Contact** alongside Jodie Foster. This movie has similar themes as Interstellar and also focuses on religion and the impact a discovery of alien intelligence would have on society. The script was adapted from a book by the late Carl Sagan, eminent cosmologist, author, and proponent of knowledge. Given how **2001** can be a difficult movie to watch, **Contact** is the one I would recommend the most.\n\nAs a space survival movie, The Martian is slightly unique in that it is probably the best one out there. **Red Planet** is its B-movie equivalent, which is to say it's a far lesser but still enjoyable movie. For me, the most interesting thing about The Martian was that science was the real hero of the story and that is extremely rare. "}

{"title":"Why I started a free, on-demand curation service for Netflix","selftext":"I started Sense (www.wemakesense.co) because I increasingly became concerned with how Netflix was handling the recommendation portion of their product.  I saw an ever-consuming reliance on data and computers that strayed away from what recommendations should be about.  I wanted to make recommendations more human.\n\nBelow are some quick, short examples of the issues that Sense is working on correcting:\n\n- Your recommended 'Top Picks' is a list of 25+ movies\n\n**This is a subset list of a list.  You're already swarmed with movie choices in Netflix.  You still have to decide between a ton of options here**\n\n\n- 1-5 star rating systems and predictors miss the point of recommendations\n\n**The goal of a recommender is to give you a movie that you'll enjoy spending your time in.  It's not to give you something you'll like '4.223' or '3.4445' stars out of 5.  The essence of a recommender is lost in this detail**\n\n\n- Recommending fully done by computers.  No personal touch.\n\n**Human curation can be infused into the system without total overhaul**\n\n\n- You can love Fantasia without being a kid\n\n**After watching Fantasia, you'll be presented with suggestions to watch children's movies next.  This is because of a reliance on a 'kids' tag to the movie.  But Netflix knows more about me than that.  They know I am a male in my 20s.  I can appreciate Fantasia for other reasons**\n\n\n- 'Top Picks' and 'More like this' are a scatterplot of all kinds of different movies\n\n**This does little to center in on the things people enjoy within a specific movie.  Instead it feels like darts being thrown at a dartboard**","body":"1. Please stop spamming this.\n\n2. Personally, I couldn't give a good goddamnn about why you started it. Your motivation doesn't matter. Why don't you tell me more about how it works and why I would want to use it?\n\n3. You might look into taking a marketing class online or get someone else to promote it or something. Your current approach is gonna lose more users than it gains."}

Excellent performances in both, but a complete lack of substance. I didn't 'get' either film. I didn't get what they wanted to achieve. \n\nBoth films contain a great deal of realistic suffering, but with no real point or purpose. In fact, if I wanted to be *really* cynical, I might even call both films vaguely exploitative. If you write a story about some aspect of mental illness, you need to have something a little more interesting to say than just \"look how bad this is. Look how much this guy suffers\". Melancholia did this wonderfully; Shame did not. In a similar way: if you want to capture the suffering of people at a particular moment in history you need something more interesting to say than just \"look at how bad these people had it\". Again: The Pianist did this wonderfully; 12 Years did not.\n\nWhat, exactly, was I meant to take from this film? I still don't really know. I *love* stories about emotional torment.

{"title":"So, perhaps kind of a strange reco request?","selftext":"What I _really_ enjoy in certain movies is the feeling of a small, intimate group (maybe 2-4 people) that are \"figuring stuff out\". I'll try to articulate as best I can and provide examples.\n\nIt can be a movie of any genre, really, though I'd prefer if it wasn't romance - and it's just a small, tight-knit crew, faced with some situation that requires some... *struggles to find the right word* ...in russian there's a perfect word for this, \"размышления\"...it's almost like a dialectic thought process with others where you get to be a fly on the wall.\n\nI've found that single-location movies will typically fit the bill.\n\nOk, examples:\n\nLike, in the movie [Sphere](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120184/?ref_=nv_sr_1), when the crew comes back from the first encounter with the Sphere and they're discussing how the ship came to be there.\n\nOr in [Enemy of the State](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120660/?ref_=nv_sr_6), when Smith and Hackman are at the cafe talking about how \"In guerrilla warfare they taught us to use our weaknesses as strengths\", and strategize.\n\nThe movie [Exam](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1258197/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4) was basically all like this.\n\nNational Treasure, obvious choice; Clue, another obvious choice....\n\nSincerly hope you guys got the idea.

The thing is, they're being tracked down by an unknown organization and they don't know why. This is one of my favourite shows ever made and you should definitely give it a go.\n\n[Broadchurch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2249364/) is a slow burning detective mini-series. It's about a murder of a young boy in a small town where we found out that not everything appears as is. Very good, but it is a slow-burner.\n\n[Se7ven](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/) is a classic.\n\n[I saw the Devil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588170/).

You're already swarmed with movie choices in Netflix.  You still have to decide between a ton of options here**\n\n\n- 1-5 star rating systems and predictors miss the point of recommendations\n\n**The goal of a recommender is to give you a movie that you'll enjoy spending your time in.  It's not to give you something you'll like '4.223' or '3.4445' stars out of 5.  The essence of a recommender is lost in this detail**\n\n\n- Recommending fully done by computers.  No personal touch.\n\n**Human curation can be infused into the system without total overhaul**\n\n\n- You can love Fantasia without being a kid\n\n**After watching Fantasia, you'll be presented with suggestions to watch children's movies next.  This is because of a reliance on a 'kids' tag to the movie.  But Netflix knows more about me than that.  They know I am a male in my 20s.  I can appreciate Fantasia for other reasons**\n\n\n- 'Top Picks' and 'More like this' are a scatterplot of all kinds of different movies\n\n**This does little to center in on the things people enjoy within a specific movie.  Instead it feels like darts being thrown at a dartboard**","body":"Can I suggest the film Moneyball?

{"title":"Why I started a free, on-demand curation service for Netflix","selftext":"I started Sense (www.wemakesense.co) because I increasingly became concerned with how Netflix was handling the recommendation portion of their product.  I saw an ever-consuming reliance on data and computers that strayed away from what recommendations should be about.  I wanted to make recommendations more human.\n\nBelow are some quick, short examples of the issues that Sense is working on correcting:\n\n- Your recommended 'Top Picks' is a list of 25+ movies\n\n**This is a subset list of a list.  You're already swarmed with movie choices in Netflix.  You still have to decide between a ton of options here**\n\n\n- 1-5 star rating systems and predictors miss the point of recommendations\n\n**The goal of a recommender is to give you a movie that you'll enjoy spending your time in.  It's not to give you something you'll like '4.223' or '3.4445' stars out of 5.  The essence of a recommender is lost in this detail**\n\n\n- Recommending fully done by computers.  No personal touch.\n\n**Human curation can be infused into the system without total overhaul**\n\n\n- You can love Fantasia without being a kid\n\n**After watching Fantasia, you'll be presented with suggestions to watch children's movies next.  This is because of a reliance on a 'kids' tag to the movie.  But Netflix knows more about me than that.  They know I am a male in my 20s.  I can appreciate Fantasia for other reasons**\n\n\n- 'Top Picks' and 'More like this' are a scatterplot of all kinds of different movies\n\n**This does little to center in on the things people enjoy within a specific movie.  Instead it feels like darts being thrown at a dartboard**","body":"Killer idea!"}

You're not sure if there's a monster or if it is just the work of men.\n\nIf you want more clear cut monsters, I really liked Frailty for showing the fight against demons.

Here are a couple. \n\nWar: Apocalypse Now - the classic film about the Vietnam war. One of the best films ever made, in my opinion. \n\nRomantic Comedy: Annie Hall - woody allen's academy award winning story of a deeply neurotic man and the woman he loves. Another classic. \n\nCrime: Goodfellas - One of Martin Scorcese's kick ass mob stories. I remember being amazed that a movie could be so well made. The music and the editing are unbelievable. \n\nHeist: Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels - This movie is just fun as all hell and if you haven't seen it, it's worth a watch. Very funny and definitely influenced a lot of movies that followed it. \n\nWestern: The Good the Bad and the Ugly - Clint Eastwood stars in Sergio Leone's classic gunslinger story. Such a cool movie. \n\nFrench Romance: Amelie - excellent French film. Love story and all around crowd pleaser. Good date movie, maybe. \n\nAction: Terminator 2 - ok, I guess you could watch terminator 1 first, but T2 really is the greatest action movie of all time, IMHO. If you like action movies at all this one should go on your list. It changed action movies forever. \n\nCult: Big Trouble In Little China - Kurt Russel battles the forces of Chinese black magic in the eighties. One of my personal favorites and one that's got nothing to do with being cultured. It's a classic and an awesome movie. \n\nAnyway, being cultured in cinema is overrated. Just look for movies you can enjoy. "}

Others just paint a rather barebones narrative and allow you to draw your own meaning (2001, Mr. Nobody). \n\nPhilosophy can extend to existentialism, too, and that includes movies like Manhattan, Her, Saturday Night Fever, Gattaca, Into the Wild, The Graduate. These are my personal favorite types of movies because I think existentialism is so easy to relate to for people.\n\nA nice balance for me are things like I Heart Huckabees, Midnight in Paris, A Clockwork Orange, American Beauty, and Beginners - these movies all have plots revolving around some sort of philosophical theme but can be enjoyed separate from that if you so choose.

It has a western feel, although it is set in the snowy mountains of Austria.  The plotline is a slow burn, and the story is just fantastic.  Great cinematography as well.  It's also presently streaming on Netflix, but I would recommend watching the original with subtitles, and not the dubbed version Netflix is offering.  My understanding is that the dubbed version was poorly done.\n\nEdit:  I also want to recommend [Hackney's Finest](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2167819/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1).\n\nThis is one of the funniest dark comedies I've ever seen.  The movie is centered around a young, carefree heroin user and his drug induced buddies, who are under investigation by a pair of very crooked cops in Hackney.  The British accents can be very thick in some parts, but this movie is full of moments that produce raucous laughter.  I can't recommend this one enough.\n"}

Any one expecting to see a comedy would have walked out bitterly disappointed within minutes.  This movie was soundly panned by both critics (many of whom did not even bother to watch it before writing their reviews) and by audiences as well.  It is a low budget movie without broad appeal - but for those interested in a good mystery drama, with a profound theme, the nature of 'Truth', this is a very good film."}

Now avoiding failure by never trying to succeed, she works as an anonymous retail clerk in a Niagara Falls novelty shop, and lives alone in a trailer park. But the thin comfort of intentionally low expectations can not protect her when inanimate animals begin talking to her, telling her what to do, and driving her to distraction until she does as they say. \n\nWonderfalls starred the brilliant and beautiful Canadian actress [Caroline Dhavernas](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm1445763072/tt0361256). It was created by Bryan Fuller, the creator of Pushing Daisies, Dead Like Me, and Hannibal; Todd Holland, director from Malcolm In The Middle; and Tim Minear of Firefly fame (long time Joss Whedon collaborator) who helped produce, direct and write not only for Firefly, but for Angel, Drive, Dollhouse, and Terriers as well.\n\nWonderfalls, is one of the best comedy series ever made, and one of the most truly unique shows ever on TV, yet almost no one has heard of it, because like Firefly, Wonderfalls was the next to suffer at the tender mercy of Fox's incompetent marketing.\n\nLike they did with Firefly, once again with Wonderfalls, Fox managed to seize defeat from the jaws of victory, by starting the series mid-season with little advertising, and intentionally mislabeling Wonderfalls as a drama instead of a comedy (they did this because they were selling the show to their advertisers as the new Joan of Arcadia). They played the episodes out of order, changed the show time with little reason or notice, and then canceled Wonderfalls after only 4 episodes, without even bothering to show the other 9 episodes they already had made - because again like Firefly, 'Wonderfalls failed to gather a following'.\n\nLike Pushing Daisies, Wonderfalls has tremendous charm, beautiful imagery and a wonderful sense of humor, and like Firefly, Wonderfalls has a great cast, sympathetic characters, brilliant dialog, and plenty of 90 degree plot twists. \n\nBtw Jewel Staite (Kaylee from Firefly) is a guest star in some of the episodes and Lee Pace (yes the pie-man from Pushing Daisies) is a regular on the series. This is a must watch for Firefly fans and Pushing Daisies fans as well.\n\nAnd like Firefly, Wonderfalls was canceled by Fox - so you know it had to be good.\n"}

What are some of your favorites that either no one saw, or were unfairly (to you) panned by the masses?\n\nIf your movie was panned, why is it actually good?","body":"Dead Snow 2. Dead Snow received a lot of hype and people either knew to love or hate it (it's about Nazi Zombies after their stolen gold). Dead Snow 2 is so much better but the assumption that sequels suck mean that no one has seen it either. In my mind, Dead Snow 1 is like Evil Dead 2 (the version they wanted to shoot with budget) and then Dead Snow 2 is like Evil Dead 3 where they just got balls out crazy.\n\nI also really liked Lady in the Water. Shyamalan gets a lot of shit but I think that this was his last enjoyable movie that I watched. I am fond of Urban Fantasy, stories-within-stories and meta-contextual movies. This move is all three. I think you require a certain level of 'literacy' before watching Lady in the Water. As another example for a film that people love: Cabin in the Woods. If you are not a fan of horror movies, Cabin in the Woods isn't clever or makes sense. Lady in the Water requires the same sort familiarity with the quest genre.\n\nI also normally hate Found Footage movies as they're an excuse for a company to shave 20-30 million dollars off of making a movie. There are a few exceptions that the cheapness enhances the film: Chronicle, Trollhunter, V/H/S, V/H/S 2 and Grave Encounters.\n\nI'm also fond of South Korean New Wave. I love gangster movies and here are a bunch of movies that have been updated. The last greatest North American gangster movie was Wolf of Wall Street but that isn't about the criminals I'm interested in. Before that, what? The Departed? That was made in 2007. With South Korean New Wave, I get a shit load of movies that have been shot recently so they look great. Another plus is that due to the lack of firearms in South Korea, each attempted assassination is a gritty affair where it can go either way. Eastern Promises bathhouse scene is a perfect example of drama: it could go either way. Plus I'm a fan of martial arts movies.\n\nThat's why Raid 2 was my favourite movie last year. You had the different gangs vie for dominance but once a leader gave the order to whack a guy, it wasn't one and done shoot out. \n\nEssentially, I like action movies because they take skill to make but the key is to have medium budgets. The reason is that you want the star to be doing the stunts, which a studio will have to insure. If the person is a superstar, then they're too expensive to insure and that's why you get so many action blockbusters look like shit because of the continual cuts of stunt doubles. I'm here for the charisma of the actor. That's why the only high budget action movies I'll watch will be animated or Tom Cruise - Tom Cruise is always an Executive Producer, he always does his own stunts and has the power to say \"Yes, you will be insuring me.\" Edge of Tomorrow is a prime example of this: high power mecha combat that looks realistic because Tom Cruise was willing to do the wire-fu and not rely on CGI that will look dated in 6 months. Jack Reacher is an amazing action-thriller because of this as well.\n\nThat's why with the relative unknown actors in South Korean movies, they can insure them and do *great* action scenes. Look towards Oldboy, Man from Nowhere and I Saw the Devil.\n\nOther great medium budget (15-50M) movies include:\n\n- John Wick\n\n- Snowpiercer\n\n- Ip Man\n\n- Ip Man 2\n\n- Mr. Brooks\n\n- Payback\n\n- The Losers\n\n- Kung Fu Hustle\n\n- Dredd (already listed though)\n\n- RocknRolla\n\nHaywire, for example, is an amazing action movie that got no one to watch because it starred a relatively unknown MMA fighter. With the medium budget and her skills, it was easy to insure her so they could actually do fight scenes that don't cut around and hide the action. The fights are gritty and real. I can't wait until Ronda Roussey gets her own action movie - the best fights in Fast 7 and Expendables 3 were her. Stop with the MMA shit, go be real action stars! \n\nIt's why Tony Jaa's movies got progressively worse. In Ong Bak he was some unknown guy so it was no problem having him do all of this dangerous stuff. Ong Bak 2, a lot safer because he was an international star. Then you look at Fast 7 and I don't see the man from Ong Bak.\n\nStudios have the opportunity to make unforgettable movies but forgo that for something safe, generic and forgotten. All because of insuring their stars. They're getting paid millions of dollars, take the temporary abuse for something that lasts forever. Sorry for dropping the essay but the current state of action movies annoys me to no end. "}

Don't let previews for the first one fool you, it grips you and doesn't let you go--and I'm super picky about my docs. Although, I'd  have to beg you that if you're going to watch it, you should really watch all three."}

At least in my interpretation, the film depicts losing a loved one as something you must confront and address. In the film an evil force awakens in the life of a grieving widow, one who might be tempted to deny her feelings of grief in order to relieve some level of anxiety, just as she initially denies the existence of the Babadook. As we know from the demonic pop-up book, denying the existence of the Babadook allows it to grow stronger and it even becomes more dictative of the protagonists life, but in the end she _must_ accept it, as this entity will always be a part of her life.

There is a scene where the woman cop goes undercover as a high class escort to a party. She is there to rescue another girl and is unarmed. Upon admission she is drugged and during the party men are trying to solicit sex from her.\n\nThe scene you want: She picks up a small paring knife from a bar setup and secrets it away. When she goes to leave the party a bouncer stops grabs her. She cuts and stabs him maybe 6 times in the space of a few seconds, probably killing him.\n\nThis scene might work for you because she reverts to her training in that situation.

Even though it's more of a drama/psychological thriller, there were some similar scenarios that play out completely differently than The Martian because of the crew's personalities.\n\nNo one here has mentioned shows, so I would also recommend the [Alone](http://www.history.com/shows/alone/season-1/episode-1) on the History Channel.  They drop off 10 survivalists in the Canadian wilderness just before winter, cut off from each other and the rest of the world, with only 10 items and a box of video equipment to document everything (along with a satellite phone for tapping out).  They are told to stay as long as they possibly can and that the last one will win the prize money.  They don't know if it will be a week, or a month, or years.\n\nThe survivalists film everything themselves and the only contact they have is with medics and crew that come every week or so to do a physical/mental evaluation and swap batteries/memory cards. The show does an amazing job at depicting how strong willed and capable people can start to go crazy when cut off from the world and faced with adversity."}
